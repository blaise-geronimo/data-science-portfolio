# ðŸ“Š Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! I'm Blaise, a Data Science student at UST with a passion for machine learning, financial analytics, and applied AI. This portfolio showcases selected projects, laboratory activities, and exercises demonstrating skills in Python, machine learning, data visualization, and more.

## Repository Overview
This repository contains topic-focused subfolders. Each folder typically includes one or more Jupyter notebooks and, when needed, supporting data or utility scripts.

Top-level folders:
- Anaplan Consolidation â€” Scripts for consolidating data from Anaplan exports.
- Constructive Heuristics Induction for Language Learning (CHILL) Replica â€” A small replica/experiment for CHILL parsing with Python scripts and a demo notebook.
- Error Based Learning â€” Notebook(s) demonstrating error-driven learning concepts; includes small train/test CSVs.
- Geospatial Analysis â€” Geospatial EDA and visualization with provided datasets (regions GeoJSON, population, median pay, rice consumption).
- Network Analysis â€” Network/graph analysis notebook and sample training JSON.
- Similarity Based Learning â€” Notebook exploring similarity-based methods, with sample Airbnb-like listings data.
- Student Depression Prediction â€” A classification project on a provided dataset.
- Targeted Wellness Identification via Classification and Evaluation (TWICE) â€” A self-harm detection project; includes data splits, a HuggingFace tokenizer/config, and a small Tagalog stopwords utility.
- Time Series â€” Time series analysis notebook and a supporting diagram.

## Reproducibility Notes
- Random seeds: Where applicable, notebooks set seeds for basic reproducibility; results can still vary by library versions.
- Environment: Consider creating a per-project virtual environment if you plan to install specific versions for a given notebook.

## Data and Privacy
- Included CSV/JSON files are provided strictly for educational and demonstration purposes. Some datasets are small samples derived for coursework.
- Please verify licensing/usage constraints before reusing any data or assets.
